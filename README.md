# About
This is my fork of Geany, the small and lightweight integrated development environment. 

In addition to all the features found in geany, this fork adds:
- a nicer 'find in files' output, where matches are highlighted and grouped by files
- a multi-tab 'find in files' so that the history of searches is kept in the bottom panel.

I'll try to add some more features as time passes. The main things I can think of today are:
- autocompletion in 'find in files'
- compare to git HEAD, using a split window
- using inotify for the treebrowser to keep in sync with the filesystem
- etc... nothing is really set in stone yet...
